        W3C standards define an <b>Open Web Platform</b> for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich<br> interactive experiences, powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. Although
        the boundaries of the platform continue to evolve,</br> industry leaders speak nearly in unison about how <span style="color:blue">HTML5</span> will be the cornerstone for this platform. But the full strength of the platform relies on<br> many more technologies that W3C and
        its partners are creating,including <i>CSS, SVG, WOFF<i>, the Semantic Web stack, <i>XML<i>, and a variety of APIs.</div><br>
    <div style="width: 54vw;background-color: lightblue">W3C develops these technical specifications and guidelines through a process designed to maximize consensus about the content of a technical<br> report, to ensure high technicaland editorial quality, and to earn endorsement by W3C and the broader
        community.</div></br>
